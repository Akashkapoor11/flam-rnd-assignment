How to run the parts in this package:

1) Web viewer
   cd web
   npm install
   npm run build
   # serve files
   npx http-server . -p 8080
   # open http://127.0.0.1:8080

2) Android app (skeleton)
   - Open the 'android' directory in Android Studio.
   - Import the Gradle project and build.
   - This skeleton contains the CMakeLists and a native stub (no OpenCV).
   - To add OpenCV, follow OpenCV Android SDK integration steps.

3) JNI native code
   - jni/native-lib.cpp is a minimal stub. Replace with OpenCV processing as required.

Note: This ZIP is a minimal template that contains all required files for structure.
Replace the native processing code with actual OpenCV code and integrate OpenCV SDK if you need full native processing.
